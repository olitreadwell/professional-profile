## Questions

### What is your employment authorization status in the United States?

I'm a USA citizen, with passport. I do not need sponsorship to remain in the country or to work for an employer.

I was born in the United Kingdom, to a English mother and American father. I have dual citizenship with the UK and do not need sponsorship to remain in the country (UK) or to work for an employer.

### What range of compensation do you have in mind?

I'm looking for an industry, market, and locale competitive salary in line with the role and responsibilities as well as the unique experience and education I bring to the role. I have been working as a professional software engineer for 6+ years and base my salary requirements on sites like LinkedIn Salary, GlassDoor, PayScale and other aggregated data sources. From within these sources I consider the range of salaries that are within 1-2 standard deviations from the median for work that is 30+ hours per week. 

### Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it.

One of the goals that I have probably continued to show as my work to set goals and surpass them, is when I wanted to move abroad after University.

I knew that I had wanted to move abroad for some time, having been born in the United Kingdom and been lucky enough to travel extensively with my family during my childhood.

After graduating Chapman University, I began working with the Tech Coast Angels venture fundraising network and a co-working space in Southern California. This was my first experience building a career in technology, after having been engrossed with it since sitting with my mum in her home office while she worked for IBM.

I chose to fly to Australia, without having ever been there, without really knowing what I was going to do there.

Within six months time, through networking, volunteering, and working 60+ hours for many weeks, I had become the lead organizer for one of the largest technology meetups in Melbourne, Australia. I was a fellow at Adventure Capital, supporting their deal flow, co-working space, and angel investment network.

I gained experience as a freelancer, an operations manager, a volunteer, participant, winner, and organizer of Startup Weekend.

It taught me the strength of hard work and beyond that the capacity to learn quickly and throw myself into new experiences that would grow me.

### Give me an example of when you showed initiative and took the lead.

There was an opportunity while working at Galvanize where we were talking about how to expand the capabilities of the Career Services team. It was run by a single person and she was having to do a lot of mock interviews with students. The mock interview process was she would conduct an interview and give then give feedback.

We had been doing something similar in class with having students stand up in class and give lightning talks off random topics. These lightning talks were propelled by an application built by our lead instructor.

I took a look at the code and determined that I could clone it, fork it and build an application that both the career services manager and the students could use without having a person in the room.

This allowed the students to sit down and record themselves answering questions and then go back and listen to their responses.

The students received valuable feedback and we were able to improve the interviewing skills of the student engineers without tying up the single limited resource of the career manager.

### What is your greatest strength?

I think my greatest strength is understanding that there are always opportunities where one can contribute to a team. Whether you think they are trivial or large. The force that has been most impactful in my life is coming in and contributing where I can.

I've done this by showing up at events at co-working spaces and helping move chairs. Whether it is pulling a small ticket off the backlog, refactoring code, writing documentation, adding tests, auditing the issues queue, or reviewing pull requests.

This is something I consider whenever I arrive into a new role. How do I make an impact on day one? There's so many ways.

While as a software engineer with Bypass Mobile, I took it upon myself to document and video tape portions of the onboarding process. Doing so gave Bypass Mobile's technology team feedback of holes that were missing within their onboarding while also working to fill those gaps of knowledge.

This capacity to get in there and do the work, small and large makes my role as an engineer much more team-focused than it is centered around what feature will get me the best exposure on a team.

### What does a good company culture look like to you?

My work in technology has focused on solving problems, collaborating with high performing teams, building on actionable feedback, and delivering impactful incremental solutions. There’s a lot happening in that statement, let me break it down into key factors I look for.

Mindful growth - Technology falters on this difficult precipice of needing to move quickly without burning out. Mindful growth is a balancing act with the clear understanding of the drivers of the business, sustainable people practices, and industry best practices. I look for teams that value investment in their peers, seeing it as a way to drive the business forward. I check in with my connections about what work is like and how well a company retains talent. I hope to have conversations that are cognizant of the tradeoffs for decisions and reflective on ways to improve. 

Empathetic communication - I recently read this great article by Cate Huston, Engineering manager at Automattic, about communication. (https://qz.com/work/1587170/the-five-types-of-communication-problems-that-destroy-company-morale/) Empathetic communication shows up to me in careful code reviews that hope to educate while also ensure the company’s codebase improves. It’s part of speaking together rather than over each other in time-constrained meetings. Even going so far as to revolve around text-based discussions where context and tone are hopefully provided alongside information. 

Methodical action - For a business to be sustainable it has to make money. Across my time in startups and as an engineer, I do my best not to forget that. For this reason, I appreciate companies that take action to integrate ongoing feedback relating to both quantitative and qualitative data. In the same vein, I want a transparent understanding of the metrics behind the goals of my work. This allows me to be innovative while comprehending how my work contributes to the performance of the organization. 

These factors of company culture have come from a decade as an employee with 8 of those years embedded in high velocity technology companies. I am confident these factors build sustainably successful companies that attract, grow, and retain the types of teammates I want to collaborate with.

### On Technical Assessments/Code Challenges

I find that coding by myself isn't my preferred method of contributing to coding projects. I really like working with a team, partaking in the code review process, and improving my skills and those of others by working with other engineers.

Through work I've done on code challenges, I have been able to identify ways in which working on a code challenge feels different to me than writing code for a team.

#### 1. I am more hesitant to ask questions

My typical coding process includes asking probing questions about the tickets that I am working on.

I've actually come up with a checklist of these questions, I ask myself and I ask the folks who assigned me the work. The questions tend to consist of the following:

- What feature/aspect of this work is of greatest priority?
- What code standards are in place in this repo?
- What's the deadline on this?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- Is there a ticket or card somewhere where I can track my progress of this work?
- Does my manager or lead have a preference in how I implement this?
- Who worked on this or something similar last?
- Are there other examples of this in the code?
- Is there a good pull request to use as a model?
- Is this creating new code or modifying the legacy code?
- Is there documentation for what I'm working on?
- Are there design specifications for what I'm working on?
- Who are the gatekeepers of the repo I'm working in?
- Are there CONTRIBUTING guidelines for the repo I'm working on?

... etc.

Often times in coding challenges, I do not feel I have the opportunity to ask these questions.

For that reason, when I receive coding challenges I like to ask these questions. With the focus being, "Which of these is most important? If I could only deliver one of the asked for criteria within an hour what would it be? What if I could only deliver  2?"

#### 2. As a software engineer, my goal is to learn from my team and solicit ongoing feedback.

When working on a coding challenge, particularly one where I'm not embedded in a code review process it feels more difficult to go ahead and get that ongoing feedback. 

Within a code review process, I get ongoing feedback on my work in progress and not just the finalized product. While working on a code challenge, it feels much more focused on the end deliverable then how I got there. 

I tend to agree with the idea that "software is never finished, only released." In my work this means I balance iterating from an initial idea to a shipped piece of software, knowing that there is usually something I'm not happy with and hope to go back and improve upon.

My hope is that when I get started on a ticket, I will ask questions and from there begin to learn about the code that is present or find examples of this feature elsewhere. I'll delve into where I think this code will go and mock up a simple test of it. Usually, this involves pushing up my current committed code, comments and all, and opening a work in progress branch.

After working on the intial proof of concept, I like to bring my idea to another engineer and chat with them about the work. See if they have any design suggestions or areas they think I'm not considering right off the bat. I think this process prevents me from veering off in the wrong direction early on.

#### 3. Invested time versus finished project

When I work on a challenge, it is for a future employer. I feel I am being evaluated on the final bit of work that I am turning in. Not the steps I took to get there. Not the way I communicated about it along the way. Not the decisions I made. Not the research I did. It is not a holistic representation of the way I prefer to code.

Not to forget that time constraints seem to go out the window at this point, even if given a limited time frame on the work.

Would I rather turn in something that feels like not the best representation of my work in 1 hour, 3 hours? Or would I rather spend a greater amount of time and hope that the work looks good enough for the folks evaluating it?

This is a trap. I end up losing myself on smaller problems. I go way over my time. I lose confidence in my capacity to show my best work.

If I was in a production level environment and was told I have 1 hour to deliver something to production, I wouldn't write pretty code, or probably even tests, it wouldn't be accessible, and I would probably ignore most non-critically blocking aspects of a code review. This would be a something is on fire scenario and I would ship something that would "work". I would communicate all of this, including the trade-offs of work of this sort, to my team, in my code, and in my pull request. Once it was delivered and nothing was broken, I'd prioritize following that work up with other improvements. I'd focus on adding tests, refactoring the code to look better, and adding the secondary features that were asked for.

The info above may not change the code that I wrote for a technical challenge. Hopefully, it gives you a clearer insight into the way that I contribute to a team. It also helps me to think about how I will work on technical assessments in the future.

All this said, there are numerous examples of companies out there that do not require riddles, mind puzzles, whiteboard interviews, or lengthy technical challenges as part of their interview process. I like to recommend these resources on interviewing, which may suggest alternatives to the types of technical challenge practices that you have.
