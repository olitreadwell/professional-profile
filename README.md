## Questions

### Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it.

One of the goals that I have probably continued to show as my work to set goals and surpass them, is when I wanted to move abroad after University.

I knew that I had wanted to move abroad for some time, having been born in the United Kingdom and been lucky enough to travel extensively with my family during my childhood.

After graduating Chapman University, I began working with the Tech Coast Angels venture fundraising network and a co-working space in Southern California. This was my first experience building a career in technology, after having been engrossed with it since sitting with my mum in her home office while she worked for IBM.

I chose to fly to Australia, without having ever been there, without really knowing what I was going to do there.

Within six months time, through networking, volunteering, and working 60+ hours for many weeks, I had become the lead organizer for one of the largest technology meetups in Melbourne, Australia. I was a fellow at Adventure Capital, supporting their deal flow, co-working space, and angel investment network.

I gained experience as a freelancer, an operations manager, a volunteer, participant, winner, and organizer of Startup Weekend.

It taught me the strength of hard work and beyond that the capacity to learn quickly and throw myself into new experiences that would grow me.

### Give me an example of when you showed initiative and took the lead.

There was an opportunity while working at Galvanize where we were talking about how to expand the capabilities of the Career Services team. It was run by a single person and she was having to do a lot of mock interviews with students. The mock interview process was she would conduct an interview and give then give feedback.

We had been doing something similar in class with having students stand up in class and give lightning talks off random topics. These lightning talks were propelled by an application built by our lead instructor.

I took a look at the code and determined that I could clone it, fork it and build an application that both the career services manager and the students could use without having a person in the room.

This allowed the students to sit down and record themselves answering questions and then go back and listen to their responses.

The students received valuable feedback and we were able to improve the interviewing skills of the student engineers without tying up the single limited resource of the career manager.

### What is your greatest strength?

I think my greatest strength is understanding that there are always opportunities where one can contribute to a team. Whether you think they are trivial or large. The force that has been most impactful in my life is coming in and contributing where I can.

I've done this by showing up at events at co-working spaces and helping move chairs. Whether it is pulling a small ticket off the backlog, refactoring code, writing documentation, adding tests, auditing the issues queue, or reviewing pull requests.

This is something I consider whenever I arrive into a new role. How do I make an impact on day one? There's so many ways.

While as a software engineer with Bypass Mobile, I took it upon myself to document and video tape portions of the onboarding process. Doing so gave Bypass Mobile's technology team feedback of holes that were missing within their onboarding while also working to fill those gaps of knowledge.

This capacity to get in there and do the work, small and large makes my role as an engineer much more team-focused than it is centered around what feature will get me the best exposure on a team.

### What range of compensation do you have in mind?

I'm looking for an industry competitive salary in line with the role and responsibilities as well as the unique experience and education I bring to the role.

### What is your employment authorization status in the United States?

I'm a USA citizen, with passport. I do not need sponsorship to remain in the country or to work for an employer.

### What does a good company culture look like to you?

My work in technology has focused on solving problems, collaborating with high performing teams, building on actionable feedback, and delivering impactful incremental solutions. There’s a lot happening in that statement, let me break it down into key factors I look for.

Mindful growth - Technology falters on this difficult precipice of needing to move quickly without burning out. Mindful growth is a balancing act with the clear understanding of the drivers of the business, sustainable people practices, and industry best practices. I look for teams that value investment in their peers, seeing it as a way to drive the business forward. I check in with my connections about what work is like and how well a company retains talent. I hope to have conversations that are cognizant of the tradeoffs for decisions and reflective on ways to improve. 

Empathetic communication - I recently read this great article by Cate Huston, Engineering manager at Automattic, about communication. (https://qz.com/work/1587170/the-five-types-of-communication-problems-that-destroy-company-morale/) Empathetic communication shows up to me in careful code reviews that hope to educate while also ensure the company’s codebase improves. It’s part of speaking together rather than over each other in time-constrained meetings. Even going so far as to revolve around text-based discussions where context and tone are hopefully provided alongside information. 

Methodical action - For a business to be sustainable it has to make money. Across my time in startups and as an engineer, I do my best not to forget that. For this reason, I appreciate companies that take action to integrate ongoing feedback relating to both quantitative and qualitative data. In the same vein, I want a transparent understanding of the metrics behind the goals of my work. This allows me to be innovative while comprehending how my work contributes to the performance of the organization. 

These factors of company culture have come from a decade as an employee with 8 of those years embedded in high velocity technology companies. I am confident these factors build sustainably successful companies that attract, grow, and retain the types of teammates I want to collaborate with.
